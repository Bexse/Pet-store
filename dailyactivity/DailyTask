Friday: All day was dedicated for the backend. The structure of seems to have one a user containing embedded documents (pets and their vaccine). 
Saturday: started working connecting front end and back end. Seems working, however, computer crushed and now switch to Mac.
Sunday: working on front end on async and login. Tonight, jwt and display will continue. 


Monday: I started the day with refereeing some material about back end authentication and how jet works. I spent huge time to set up authentication and found it most challenging. Monday night started the crud operations. 
Tuesday: Continued with crud operations and other requirements.

Generally I have encountered the following challenges in this project. The First was technical including switching pcs , crashes of software Xcode (trying to understand and solve equally consumed time and energy). 
The second challenge is related to using help. I have to improve in this category, as I always tries to fix by myself despite clear statement of any kind of help from Prof. The last challenge is grasping the whole project idea once. 
I saw my interpretation diffuses intermittently.

Finally, this project gave me a better understating concepts taught in class, and referring new materials to incorporate in projects, and off course few hrs of sleep. Thank you Prof.
